Features

Preprocessing of email text (removal of stop words, punctuation, tokenization, etc.)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer

Training using a Machine Learning model (Naive Bayes, SVM, or Random Forest)

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

User-friendly script for classifying new emails


Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-Learn

Pandas

Numpy

NLTK

Matplotlib / Seaborn
